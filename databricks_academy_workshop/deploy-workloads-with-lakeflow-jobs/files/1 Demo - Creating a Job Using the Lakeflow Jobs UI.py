# MAGIC # 1 - Creating a Job Using the Lakeflow Jobs UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lesson, we will start by creating a job using a single notebook and SQL Query and exploring the Lakeflow Jobs UI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demonstration, we will walk through the process of creating and running a Lakeflow Job in Databricks. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The demo will include:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Creating a new job with two tasks: one using a notebook and the other using a SQL query.
# MAGIC - Modifying task configurations.
# MAGIC - Exploring the Lakeflow Jobs UI to understand how to modify, monitor, and manage job runs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
# MAGIC - Schedule a notebook task and Sql task in a Databricks Workflow Job
# MAGIC - Running a Job which have multiple task
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Data Overview 
# MAGIC We are going to use a retail dataset for this course across all demos. We have three different dimensions/data available: **customers data, sales data, and orders data** for our retail dataset.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE (The cluster named 'labuser')
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC    - Click **More** in the drop-down.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC    - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** window, use the first drop-down to select your unique cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.
