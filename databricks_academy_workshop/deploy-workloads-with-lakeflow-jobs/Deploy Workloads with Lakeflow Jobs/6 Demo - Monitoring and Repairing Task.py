# MAGIC ## G. Repairing Job Runs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can view the notebooks used in a task, including their output, as part of a job run. This helps diagnose errors. You can also re-run specific tasks in a failed job run.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Consider this example:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You are developing a job with several notebooks. During a job run, one of the tasks fails. You can update the code in that notebook and re-run the failed task and any tasks that depend on it. You can also change task parameters and re-run the task. Let's walk through this process:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. In the upper-right corner, click **Repair run**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Open [Task Files/Lesson 6 Files/6.1 - Transforming Customers Orders State Wise Data]($./Task Files/Lesson 6 Files/6.1 - Transforming Customers Orders State Wise Data) and notice that the `def clean_common` function uses the wrong column name.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Update the column name from `customer` to `customer_name` in code script.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ![Lesson06_script_snip.png](./Includes/images/Lesson06_script_snip.png)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Return to your job run. In the upper-right corner, click **Repair run**. Make sure the **transforming_customers_orders_data** task is selected.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. The "1" in the **Repair run** button indicates that Databricks has selected both the failed task and the dependent task. You can select or deselect any tasks you wish to re-run.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 6. Wait for the run to complete.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## H. Reviewing the Run
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once your job run is successful, go back to your job and click on the **Runs** tab. Click on the latest run, then click on **transforming_customers_orders_data**. In the top left corner, you will notice the run status, which is a dropdown list. By clicking on each dropdown option, you can see the output of your task run. Notice the code difference between the successful and failed tasks. You should see the correct column name (`customer_name`) in the successful run.

# MAGIC ## I. Adding a Dashboard to Your Job
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we will integrate a pre-created dashboard into your job. The dashboard has been prepared for you and is stored as a JSON input file, so you don't need to create it from scratch.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### I1. Configuring Your Retail Dashboard
# MAGIC Follow these steps to view and configure your dashboard:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to **Lesson 6 Files**: [Task Files/Lesson 6 Files]($./Task Files/Lesson 6 Files) to locate the input file.
# MAGIC 2. Locate the **input_file**. This file will assist in generating a user-specific dashboard JSON file.
# MAGIC 3. Run the command below to automatically create the dashboard from the input file.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 4. Click the folder icon ![folder_icon.png](./Includes/images/folder_icon.png) on the left; you will see your dashboard along with other lab/demo notebooks.
# MAGIC 5. Ensure the dashboard name matches the one shown in the cell output above. Click the dashboard to open it.
# MAGIC 6. In the top left, click **Edit draft** to view and modify your dashboard.
# MAGIC 7. In the top right, make sure **shared_warehouse** is selected for compute. Do not use "unknown warehouse." Wait for the SQL Warehouse to start so your dashboard can render.
# MAGIC 8. Click the **Data** tab on the left. Verify that the following tables are selected:
# MAGIC    - `customers_orders_ny_gold`
# MAGIC    - `customers_orders_va_gold`
# MAGIC    - `customers_sales_summary_gold`
# MAGIC 9. Run queries on each table in the query box to gain insights. Ensure your catalog is set to **dbacademy** and your schema is your specific **labuser** schema.
# MAGIC 10. Click **Publish**. Here, you will find options for sharing dashboard permissions. Your dashboard was automatically published by the command above. But, if you make any changes, be sure to publish the dashboard again to update it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC       **Note:** Publishing the dashboard is essential to use it in your job tasks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This ensures your dashboard is connected to the correct data and compute resources.
